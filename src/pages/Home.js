There came Agentic AI, taking it one step ahead!!<br/><br/><b>Agentic AI</b> is a combination of AI and autonomous technology..<br/><br/>These Agents require minimum human supervision as they have the ability to analyze data and decision making capabilities of their own.. <br/><br/>These near human cognitions are achieved by using LLMs,ML,Deep learning and other brain usnpied sciences/engineering..<br/><br/>They are action-oriented!! <br/><br/>Looking at these developments ..Being an Electrical Engineer and an entusiast AI student..  I am working on developing skills on <b><i>Agentic AI</i></b> now !!</b></div>
